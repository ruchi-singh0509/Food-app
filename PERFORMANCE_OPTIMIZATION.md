# Performance Optimization Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Food-app project to improve application responsiveness, reduce load times, and enhance overall user experience.

## Backend Optimizations

### Redis Caching

We've implemented Redis as a caching layer to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

#### Key Features

1. **Session Store**: Redis is used to store session data, replacing the default in-memory store. This provides:
   - Improved session persistence across server restarts
   - Better scalability for distributed deployments
   - Reduced memory usage on the application server

2. **API Response Caching**: Frequently accessed endpoints are cached to reduce database load:
   - `/api/food/list` endpoint is cached for 5 minutes
   - Cache is automatically invalidated when food items are added or removed

3. **Graceful Fallback**: The application continues to function even if Redis is unavailable, falling back to in-memory storage.

#### Configuration

The Redis configuration is defined in `backend/config/redis.js` and includes:

- Connection management with automatic reconnection
- Error handling and logging
- Cache middleware for easy implementation on routes
- Cache invalidation utilities

### Usage Example

```javascript
// Apply caching to a route (duration in seconds)
router.get("/endpoint", cache(300), controllerFunction);

// Clear cache when data changes
await clearCache('cache:/api/pattern*');
```

## Frontend Optimizations

### Code Splitting

We've implemented code splitting in the React frontend to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.

#### Implementation

1. **React.lazy and Suspense**: Used to dynamically load components only when needed:
   - All page components are lazy-loaded
   - A loading indicator is shown during component loading

2. **Vite Build Optimization**:
   - Manual chunk splitting for vendor libraries
   - Separate chunks for UI components
   - Optimized asset naming for better caching
   - Terser minification with console removal for production

### Example

```jsx
// Lazy loading components
const Home = lazy(() => import('./pages/Home/Home'))

// Using Suspense for fallback UI
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
    {/* Other routes */}
  </Routes>
</Suspense>
```

## Development Proxy

A development proxy has been configured in Vite to simplify API requests during development:

```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:4000',
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
  },
},
```

## Future Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization Pipeline**: Implement automatic image resizing and compression
2. **Server-Side Rendering**: Consider implementing SSR for critical pages
3. **Service Worker**: Add offline support and asset caching
4. **Database Query Optimization**: Review and optimize MongoDB queries
5. **Content Delivery Network**: Utilize a CDN for static assets

## Monitoring Performance

Performance can be monitored using the existing monitoring endpoints:

- `/api/monitoring/metrics` - Provides system metrics including response times
- `/api/monitoring/health` - Health check endpoint

Additional client-side performance metrics could be implemented using the Web Vitals library in the future.
