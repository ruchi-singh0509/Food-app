# Accessibility Features in Food App

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the Food App to ensure it's usable by people with various disabilities, following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

## Implemented Features

### Semantic HTML
- Replaced generic `<div>` elements with semantic HTML5 elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.
- Added proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) for better document structure
- Used `<button>` elements for interactive controls instead of styled `<div>` or `<p>` elements

### ARIA Attributes
- Added `role` attributes to elements that require specific roles (e.g., `menubar`, `menu`, `menuitem`)
- Implemented `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` to provide context for elements
- Used `aria-current` to indicate current page/selection
- Added `aria-expanded` and `aria-haspopup` for dropdown menus
- Implemented `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative elements
- Added `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implemented keyboard event handlers for Enter and Space keys
- Added proper focus management for dropdown menus
- Ensured logical tab order throughout the application
- Added visible focus indicators for all interactive elements

### Visual Considerations
- Added focus styles for all interactive elements
- Ensured sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements
- Added a visually-hidden class for screen reader-only content
- Improved text alternatives for images with descriptive `alt` attributes

## Components Enhanced

### Navbar Component
- Converted to semantic `<nav>` element with proper ARIA roles
- Added keyboard navigation for dropdown menus
- Implemented proper focus management
- Added descriptive labels for icons and buttons

### FoodItem Component
- Converted to semantic `<article>` element
- Added proper button elements for add/remove actions
- Implemented keyboard event handlers
- Added descriptive ARIA labels for price and quantity information

### Cart Component
- Added proper table semantics with ARIA roles
- Implemented keyboard-accessible remove buttons
- Added descriptive labels for prices and quantities
- Used semantic form elements for promo code input

## Testing

To ensure accessibility compliance, the following testing methods are recommended:

1. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Verify all functionality can be accessed using only a keyboard
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
3. **Automated Testing**: Use tools like Axe, Lighthouse, or WAVE to identify accessibility issues
4. **Color Contrast Testing**: Verify all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements

## Future Improvements

1. Implement skip navigation links
2. Add more comprehensive form validation with error messages
3. Enhance focus management for modal dialogs
4. Implement announcements for dynamic content changes
5. Add language attributes to HTML elements
